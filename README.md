This is my first Github project for a series you can download this at anytime.
This is a basic tutorial on how to make a website.
there is a head tab you will put things in there to ad other files to the main file like a random.css and import it to Index.html

<!HTMLDOCTYPE>
<html>
    <head>
        whatever
        whatever
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>whatever</p>
    </body>
</html>
